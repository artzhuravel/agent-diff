# Request helpers — universal across apps
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These helpers raise ``AppAPIError`` (the base exception class in
# ``core/errors.py``) rather than calling per-status constructors like
# ``unauthorized()`` / ``bad_request()``. App-specific shapes vary across
# replicas: some apps' constructors return ``AppAPIError`` instances (raise
# safe), others return ``JSONResponse`` (raise breaks at runtime because
# ``raise`` needs an ``Exception`` subclass). Raising ``AppAPIError``
# directly is the one shape that's safe regardless of how the implement
# stage chose to write the per-status constructors. ``handle_exception``
# at the handler boundary converts the AppAPIError to the right
# JSONResponse for the app.

# endpoints during development receive a response that is shape-compatible
# with the target API, instead of Starlette's default plain-text
# ``"Not Found"`` or — worse — an IsolationMiddleware 500.
#
# This makes the replica behave authentically even before every endpoint
# has been implemented: the agent cannot tell from the shape of a 404
# whether the endpoint is unimplemented or genuinely missing upstream.

# AGENT INSTRUCTION: Add new Route entries ABOVE the catch-all at the

#
#   1. Fixed paths (e.g. /projects/archived) must come before parameterized
#      paths (e.g. /projects/{project_id}) so Starlette matches them first.
#   2. The ``/{_unknown_path:path}`` catch-all must always remain the LAST
#      entry in the list. Starlette matches in order, so any route placed
#      after it would be unreachable.
