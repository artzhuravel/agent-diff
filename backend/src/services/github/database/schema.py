"""ORM schema for the GitHub API replica.

Entities are added to this file one at a time during the resource
implementation loop. Each entity implementation may also add stub models
for FK dependencies marked with: # STUB — expand when implementing this resource

AGENT INSTRUCTION: Do not write this file from scratch. Each entity
implementation adds its model class to this file incrementally.
